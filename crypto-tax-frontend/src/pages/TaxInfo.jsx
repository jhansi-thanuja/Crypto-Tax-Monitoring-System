          Crypto taxation typically follows capital gains rules. When you sell
          your crypto assets for a higher price than you bought them, you
          generate a **profit (capital gain)**, which is subject to taxation.
          Conversely, if you sell at a lower price, you incur a **loss
          (capital loss)**.
